      <p class="text-lg py-2 text-justify">
        I'm a 22-year-old, final-year engineering student, and life has been an exhilarating journey of exploration and growth. My fascination with machine learning propels me into the future, as I envision contributing to the technological breakthroughs that will redefine industries. The world of DevOps beckons me too,
         as I'm captivated by the orchestration of seamless development processes.

        Amidst the whirlwind of academics and tech, I find my balance through reading, where every book is a portal to new perspectives and ideas. Cooking is my canvas of flavors, a realm where I experiment with ingredients to create culinary art that delights the senses. In the realm of nature, birdwatching is my sanctuaryâ€”a tranquil escape that lets me marvel at the elegance of avian life. As I stand on the threshold of graduation, I am a
         tapestry woven with threads of curiosity, creativity, and an unquenchable thirst for knowledge.

      <p class="text-lg py-2 text-justify">
        In my personal life I like to play video games, play with some of the friendly stray dogs and read novels.
